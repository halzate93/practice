18. What is an AudioSource?, what's the problem of having more than one on the same scene.

The Audio Source plays back an Audio Clip in the scene. The clip can be played to an audio listener or through an audio mixer.  The audio can be spread out between speakers (stereo to 7.1) (Spread) and morphed between 3D and 2D (SpatialBlend). This can be controlled over distance with falloff curves. Also, if the listener is within one or multiple Reverb Zones, reverberation is applied to the source. Individual filters can be applied to each audio source for an even richer audio experience.
