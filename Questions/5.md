5. What is a Behaviour Tree?, make an example of how they work.

A behaviour tree is a common technique used to create artificial intelligence systems, and like his name says, it works to create behaviour states for AI. It has nodes that can either perform actions or evaluate if further nodes down that branch should be executed.

An example probably be the enemy behaviour of a stealth game, where the enemies has states to react to certain circunstances. For example if the player dont make noise, the enemy state will be 'Idle' state. If the player make a little noise in the game, probably the enemy state will be 'Suspicius' state, and if the player is so louder, probably the enemy state will be 'Attack'. And state can have substates too.
