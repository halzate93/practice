1. Which data structure would be more suitable for this scenario and why?, write a short code that shows how it would be used for the methods *PlaceOrder (Order o)* and *AttendNext ()*:

  "I have a hot-dog game where the clients place their orders one by one and I have to serve them in the order they place    their orders, in other words the first client to place an order should be the first served."
  
For this type of game where it's required that the first to enter, be the first to come out, I probaly use Queue data structure, because the Queue allow that and work in that way.
  
Example code:
  
```c#
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class Question1 : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Queue<Order> orders;

    private void AttendNext()
    {
      Order next = orders.Dequeue ();
      next.Complete ();
    }
    
    private void PlaceOrder (Order o)
    {
      orders.Enqueue (o);
    }
}
```
