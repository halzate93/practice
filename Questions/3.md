3. How would you enhance the performance of the following code using data structures?

  ```c#
  public class Character
  {
    public string greeting;
    public string name;
  }

  public class Greeter
  {
    private List<Character> characters;

    public void Greet (string name)
    {
      foreach (Character c in characters)
      {
        if (c.name == name)
           Debug.Log (c.greeting);
      }
    }
  }
  ```
