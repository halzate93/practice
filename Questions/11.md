11. What is different between a directional light and a point light? Draw.

A directional light is a light that simulate better the sun light, and is used to create global ilumination. In the directional light the rotation is the only thing that matters. A point light is a light that simulate better a bulb light, and is used in inside spaces, or close scenarios. In the point light the only thing that matters is the position and not the rotation.
