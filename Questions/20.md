20. What is interpolation?, how does it apply to animation curves?, how does it know exactly the value to use at a given frame?

An interpolation is a way to generate intermediate values automatically between two values, in other words, is a transition between an 'A' value and a 'B' value. Unity uses interpolations in his animation system to generate intermediate values between each key frame, and the way in which those transitions can be affected is by using of curves. Curves are paths that follow an interpolation to generate the values between a key frame to another, and are usually used to smooth animations, or to generate faster or slower objects at the beginning or the end of an animation.

The way in that we can know the specific value at a given point in the path or curve of the function is evaluating the function of the path at the time in which we want to know the exact value of the interpolation.
