10. What is a normal map? Give an example of an scenario where it would be better to use bump maps.

A normal map is a texture that allow generate details, and works by interpreting the behavior of lights on a surface. It's usually used to generate details in a model without create additional geometry.

It's preferable to use a normal map instead of a bump map in cases where you need to optimize, and in cases where you can generate reliefs and aditional map information, that can affect performance, because the bump maps works creating the ilution of reliefs.
