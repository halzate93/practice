23. What is overdraw, how does it impact performance and what is a good way to prevent it?

Overdraw is a phenomenon that referreds when you are drawing more than once a screen pixel, or when you are drawing unnecessary objects that have a lot of alpha. This impacts performance in a drastic way, and it can be watch when you analyze the profiler statistics window related to the GPU. One way to improve this is reducing the texture sizes that have a lot of alpha to the smaller possible, another way to solve this is also creating textures atlases or even using external tools like TexturePacker that allow you to optimize the textures for frameworks like Unity.
